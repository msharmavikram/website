The below list is not complete. Further it is a first draft. I will be adding links to good papers and reference materials over a period of time. 

Recent advancements in computer architecture :

1. Accelerators (FPGA, GPU, ASIC.. )
    a. Latency critical application accelerators - like networking, financial algorithms, etc
    b. Crypto-currency or accelerators for block-chain
    c. DNA sequencing - lot of applications need accelerations here and each one require unique methodologies
    d. HLS based synthesis and parameters tuning algorithms for accelerator IPs
2. Machine learning Architecture (Includes autonomous driving, IOT…)
    a. Generalized inference architecture for DeepLearning
    b. Reduction of power, compute and area for deep learning accelerator
    c. Specialized sparse matrix architecture
    d. Distributed NoC based architecture for ML
    e. Hardware-Software co-designed for NLP, Image and Video recognitions
    f. Functional Safety architecture for autonomous driving
3. Non-Von Neumann Architecture
    a. Near Memory Computing architecture (this will get back to 80s if succeeds…!)
    b. 3D stack Memory architecture (check Architecture 2030 report)
    c. 2.5D stack Memory architecture
    d. Compute in future memory architecture like Memristor, HMC, MLC NAND, etc
    e. Asynchronous architecture
4. Silicon Photonics
    a. Silicon - Photonics integration
    b. New network topology - revisiting crossbar, delta, ring, mesh, torus- all required. (Because of Wavelength-Division multiplexing scheme. )
5. Heterogeneous computer architecture
    a. Coherence and consistency between FPGA cache, GPU and CPU in heterogeneous architecture
    b. Distributed versus local HPC designs (NUMA, NoC etc)
    c. Graph analytics
6. Secure computing or Crypto-computing or block-chain
    a. Random number generator (Yes, there is no true random number generator yet)
    b. Secure computing of sensory inputs in pipeline stages (IF, D, E, M, W and should handle context switches, etc)
7. Human computer interactions
    a. Connecting to brain or increasing the capacity of brain
    b. Augmented/Virtual reality - Motion tracking, image rendering, image merging, etc
    c. Speech recognition in noisy environment
    d. Low power always on recognition
8. Cloud Computing architecture
    a. Check Architecture - 2030 report
9. Radical architecture
    a. Quantum Computing (I think this is totally open - Full stack needs to be redesigned with QC - Check Architecture 2030 report)
    b. DNA computing
       i.  Storage of data in DNA
       ii. Fast read/write pipeline architecture for DNA computing

Updated 19 Nov 2017: Topics
**NOTE**:

1. I know i have done poor job on grouping and naming- anyways it a first draft. So I am fine. Will fix it eventually.
2. I will also add links and couple of papers that sound interesting in these topics
3. The list that I will populating will be based on my experience, reading, listening and interacting. If you have good topics and need to be added to this post, please shoot a message to me! Will be happy to add.
